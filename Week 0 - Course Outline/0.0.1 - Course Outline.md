## Week 1: Introduction to Blockchain Technology

**Objective**: Understand blockchain fundamentals, including concepts like decentralization and consensus mechanisms.

**Key Terms**: Blockchain, Decentralization, Distributed Ledger, Consensus, Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS).

### Core Topics

- **Blockchain**: A special distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers.
- **Decentralization**: No central authority. Compared to Kenya's centralized mobile money system, blockchain is decentralized.
- **Distributed Ledger**: Every participant has a copy of the ledger, ensuring transparency and security.

### Types of Blockchains

- **Public Blockchains**: Open access, like Bitcoin.
- **Private Blockchains**: Restricted access, often for business applications (e.g., Hyperledger).

### Consensus Mechanisms

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Requires participants to solve complex puzzles to validate transactions.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold.

## Week 2: Introduction to Celo and Financial Inclusion

**Objective**: Explore Celo’s mission to make financial tools accessible, especially for underserved populations.

**Key Terms**: Celo, Stablecoin, cUSD, Validator, Financial Inclusion.

### Core Topics

- **Celo’s Goals**: Making blockchain mobile-friendly and accessible for individuals without bank access.
- **Celo Architecture**: Built on Proof of Stake (PoS) for energy efficiency, with Validators ensuring network integrity.
- **Stablecoins**: Digital currencies pegged to fiat (e.g., cUSD and cEUR) to maintain stability and predictability.
- **Comparison with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain**: Celo focuses on mobile-first, low-cost transactions.

### Assignment

- **Research**: Find a project where Celo promotes financial inclusion in Kenya or East Africa.
- **Deliverable**: Submit a 1-2 page research summary.

## Week 3: Solidity Basics and Smart Contracts

**Objective**: Learn Solidity and develop simple smart contracts.

**Key Terms**: Solidity, Smart Contracts, State Variables, Functions, Remix IDE.

### Core Topics

- **Introduction to Solidity**: Solidity is the language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and Celo.
- **Data Types and Control Structures**: Review of basic data types (integers, booleans, strings) and control flow (if-statements, loops, functions).
- **Using Remix IDE**: Hands-on session with Remix to write a simple contract for storing and retrieving data (e.g., a student’s name or favorite food).

### Assignment

- **Task**: Create a basic contract on Remix to set and retrieve a message.
- **Deliverable**: Submit the contract code and a reflection on the experience.

## Week 4: Setting Up a Development Environment for Celo

**Objective**: Install and configure tools necessary for Celo development.

**Key Topics**:

- Overview of essential tools: Node.js, npm, Git, Visual Studio Code, Celo CLI, ContractKit.
- **Setup**: Step-by-step installation guides for tools and configuration for the Celo network (e.g., connecting to the Alfajores Testnet).

### Assignment

- **Task**: Write a setup guide documenting the installation process and any troubleshooting steps.
- **Deliverable**: Submit the setup guide.

## Week 5: Capstone Project - Building Your Own dApp on Celo

**Objective**: Apply skills to build a fully functional dApp on Celo.

### Core Topics

- **Project Planning**: Brainstorm and define core functionality for a dApp relevant to Kenya (e.g., micro-lending app, digital wallet, local marketplace).
- **Smart Contract Development and Testing**: Write, deploy, and test contracts on the Alfajores Testnet, including token transfers and user authentication.

### Project Requirements

- **Report**: Write a project report covering dApp purpose, technical development process, and challenges faced.
- **Presentation**: Each student presents their dApp, code snippets, and discusses technical challenges and solutions.

**Assessment**: Peer and instructor feedback, highlighting solutions and improvements.
